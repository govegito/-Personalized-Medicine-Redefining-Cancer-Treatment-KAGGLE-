<h4>
here we had an dataset of the gene varition and a reasearch paper or any documented text related to that mutation and we have to predict 
whether the gene is mutated or not or in which class the mutation lies

</h4>

<h4>
here for the gene varition column we used response encoding rather than one hot encoding and for the text we also did same but before we cleaned
the text, removing stopwords and doing more feature extraction.
</h4>

<h4>
finally comparing all the results we gained from hyperparameter tuning also choosing best alpha(for laplace smoothning) and then after
we evaluated the model using different algorithm like naive bayes, k-nearest, logistic regreassion etc.
